**Project description:** 3D-T1rho brain mapping has many useful biomedical applications but requires long data acquisition times. The goal 
of the study was to apply a fast data-driven optimization approach, bias- accelerated subset selection (BASS), to generate optimal sampling 
patterns (SPs) for compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction for brain 3D-T1ρ MRI. Five healthy volunteers were recruited and fully sampled (FS) 
Cartesian, 3D-T1ρ MRI was obtained. The performance of Poisson disc (PD) and optimized SP were compared using normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The data-driven optimized
SP provides upto 2 times (NRMSE=0.09 optimized SP vs 0.18 PD-SP) improvement in images at the highest AFs tested.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```Python
if (isAwesome):
  return True

```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

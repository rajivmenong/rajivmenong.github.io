### Learning based Optimization of data sampling for quantitative MRI brain mapping 
In this study, a fast data-driven optimization algorithm, bias-accelerated subset selection (BASS), was used to generate optimized sampling patterns for data acquisition in MRI brain mapping

### Comparison of Compressed Sensing Algorithms for accelerating quantitative MRI Brain mapping 
In this project 5 compressed sensing algorithms were tested for acceleration factors (2, 5, 10) for their ability to reconstruct quantitative brain maps compared to a fully sampled reference.

### Development of a free-breathing Cardiac MRI method using motion correction  
The goal of this project was to develop a novel MRI method that allows cardiac patients to breathe freely during an MRI imaging called late gadolinium enhancement. Robust motion correction was achieved by implementing outer volume suppressed projection navigators which was to correct for motion retrospectively.
